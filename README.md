# üöß WIP üöß

---

A minimal blog, based on markdown and [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

# Configuration

TBA

# Development

A `.nvmrc` file exists for use with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Feel free to use your own node installation, but using the node version in `.nvmrc` is recommended.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Deployment

There are _many_ ways to host a next.js app. I recommend [hosting on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/next.js/overview), but follow your ‚ù§Ô∏è.

# TODO

- [ ] Increase the amount of configuration.
